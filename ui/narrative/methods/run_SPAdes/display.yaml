parameters :
    read_libraries :
        ui-name : |
            Read library
        short-hint : |
            The libraries of reads to be assembled.

        ui-name : |
            DNA source
        short-hint : |
            The source of the sequenced DNA - either standard, single cell /
            MDA, or plasmid.

    <p>The Assemble Reads with SPAdes App allows the user to assemble a genome from reads using the <a href="http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/" target="_blank">SPAdes 3.13.0</a> assembler, which is designed for small genomes and single cell sequencing.</p>

    <p>SPAdes is a <a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5531759/”>de Bruijn graph</a>-based assembler, which is noteworthy for its approach in applying multiple de Bruijn graphs (each built with different k-mer sizes) to better handle the large variations in coverage across the genome that are a characteristic of single cell sequencing, as well as a novel method for handling paired end information [1]. It begins its assembly process by using multisized de Bruijn graphs for constructing the assembly graph while detecting and removing chimeric reads. Next, distances between the k-mers are estimated for mapping the edges of the assembly graph. Afterwards, a paired assembly graph is constructed and SPAdes outputs a set of contiguous DNA sequences (contigs).</p>

    <p>The App <b><i>only</i></b> takes paired-end reads library as input; using a single-end library will result in an error. The user sets one basic parameter for the input DNA type: “standard” for isolate DNA, “single cell” for flow-sorted bacterial cells from multiple displacement amplification (MDA), or “plasmid” for plasmid DNA. After setting the input and DNA type parameter, the user then provides a name for the output assembly.</p>

     <p>Additionally, there are three advanced input parameters: (i) minimum contig length to report (default 500), (ii) a list of k-mer sizes for the de Bruijn graphs, (iii) assembly only, which prevents any error correction. By default, SPAdes has its own methods for choosing which k-mer sizes to use, depending on the input sequence data type. The user can override automatic k-mer value selection by using the second advanced input parameter. Read more information about manually selecting k-mer values in the <a href=”http://cab.spbu.ru/files/release3.13.0/manual.html”>SPAdes user manual</a>.</p>

    <p>Upon successful completion, the App creates a KBase Assembly object, which will appear in the data pane. A <a href=”http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast”>QUAST</a> quality assessment report and summary are also generated.</p>

    <p>For metagenome assembly, please use the <a href= “https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_SPAdes/run_metaSPAdes/release”>Assemble Reads with metaSPAdes</a> App.</p>

    <p><b>Operational notes:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently the App only supports Illumina, IonTorrent, PacBIO CLR and PacBIO CCS reads</li>
      <li>The --careful flag is always used, except for metagenomic assemblies where it is not allowed.</li>
      <li>Illumina and IonTorrent reads can not be mixed in the same assembly.</li>
      <li>PacBIO CLR needs to be run with at least one accompanying Illumina or IonTorrent library.</li>
      <li>The k-mer parameter is autodetected by SPAdes if the values are not specified in input.</li>
      <li>The PHRED parameter is autodetected by EAUtils.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>SPAdes version: 3.13.0</p>
